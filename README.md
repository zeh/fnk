# FNK

FNK is a dataflow programming language. Its programs are represented by graphs ("patches") in an easy-to-tinker visual programming environment.

## Goals

* To be a visual programming environment for audio and image synthesizing and processing.
* To be easy to tinker and, as a side effect, easy to learn.
* To be easily accessible (through a browser, and a standalone application).
* Be easy to extend through external components.

## Brief history

FNK was started as [my graduation project](http://ffnnkk.org/) in 2008. The original was created in Flash and [is still available](http://ffnnkk.org/launched/).

After a [proof-of-concept exploration using JavaScript](https://github.com/zeh/fnk.js), I decided to implement FNK as a browser-based project in TypeScript. This is what this version is.

It was created for fun and learning.

## Acknowledgments

FNK is only possible because it is based in ideas started by other languages and platforms. There are plenty of those around; however, FNK is mostly inspired by [vvvv](http://vvvv.org/) and similar platforms such as [Max](http://cycling74.com/products/max/) and [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/).
